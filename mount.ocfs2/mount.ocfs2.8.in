.SH "NAME"
mount.ocfs2 \-  mount an \fIOCFS2\fR filesystem
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBmount.ocfs2\fR [\fI\-vn\fR] [\fB\-o options\fR] \fIdevice\fR \fIdir\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBmount.ocfs2\fR mounts an \fIOCFS2\fR filesystem at \fIdir\fR. It is usually
invoked indirectly by the mount(8) command when using the \fI-t ocfs2\fR option.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\_netdev\fR
The filesystem resides on a device that requires network access (used to prevent
the system from attempting to mount these filesystems until the network has
been enabled on the system). \fImount.ocfs2\fR transparently appends this option
during mount. However, users mounting the volume via /etc/fstab must explicitly
specify this mount option to delay the system from mounting the volume until
after the network has been enabled.

.TP
\fBdatavolume\fR
Use this mount option to mount volumes storing the Oracle data files,
control files, redo logs, archive logs, voting disk, cluster registry, etc.
(This mount option is only available with \fIOCFS2 1.2\fR.)

.TP
\fBnointr\fR
It ignores signals during read-write.

.TP
\fBro\fR
Mount the file system read-only.

.TP
\fBrw\fR
Mount the file system read-write.
