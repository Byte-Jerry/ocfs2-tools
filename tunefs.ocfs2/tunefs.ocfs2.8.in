tunefs.ocfs2 \- Change \fIOCFS2\fR file system parameters.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBtunefs.ocfs2\fR [\fB\-J\fR \fIjournal-options\fR] [\fB\-L\fR \fIvolume-label\fR] [\fB\-M\fR \fImount-type\fR] [\fB\-N\fR \fInumber-of-node-slots\fR] [\fB\-qSUvV\fR] [\fB\-\-backup-super\fR] \fIdevice\fR  [\fIblocks-count\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtunefs.ocfs2\fR is used to adjust \fIOCFS2\fR file system parameters on disk.
In order to prevent data loss, \fBtunefs.ocfs2\fR will not perform any
action on the specified device if it is mounted on any node in the cluster.
This tool requires the \fIO2CB\fR cluster to be online.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-J, \-\-journal\-options\fR \fIoptions\fR
Modify the journal using options specified on the command\-line.
Journal options are comma separated, and may take an argument using
the equals ('=') sign. The following options are supported:
.RS 1.2i
.TP
\fBsize\fR=\fIjournal\-size\fR
Grow the size of journal files for all the slots. Minimum size is 4M.
.RE

.TP
\fB\-L, \-\-label\fR \fIvolume\-label\fR
Change the volume label of the file system. Limit the label
to under 64 bytes.

.TP
\fB\-M, \-\-mount\fR \fImount\-type\fR
Valid types are \fIlocal\fR and \fIcluster\fR. Local mount allows
users to mount the volume without the cluster overhead and works
only with \fIOCFS2\fR bundled with Linux kernels 2.6.20 or later.

.TP
\fB\-N, \-\-node\-slots\fR \fInumber\-of\-node\-slots\fR
Use this to increase the number of slots inorder to increase the
number of nodes that can concurrently mount this volume. The maximum
value is 255.

.TP
\fB\-S, \-\-volume\-size\fR
Grow the size of the \fIOCFS2\fR file system. If \fIblocks-count\fR is not
specified, \fBtunefs.ocfs2\fR extends the volume to the current size of
the device.

.TP
\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode.

.TP
\fB\-U, \-\-uuid\-reset\fR
Change the volume UUID (auto-generated) for the file system.

.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Verbose mode.

.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Show version and exit.

.TP
\fB\-\-backup\-super\fR
Backs up the superblock to fixed offsets (1G, 4G, 16G, 64G, 256G and 1T)
on disk. This option is useful for users to backup the superblock on volumes
that the user either explicitly disallowed while formatting, or, used a
version of \fImkfs.ocfs2\fR (1.2.2 or older) that did not provide this
facility.

.TP
\fIblocks-count\fR
During resize, \fBtunefs.ocfs2\fR automatically determines the size of the given
device and grows the file system such that it uses all of the available space on
the device. This optional argument specifies that the file system should be
extended to consume only the given number of file system blocks on the device.
