ocfs_uid_gen \- Create or Recover the GUID for a node.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBocfs_uid_gen\fR [-c|-r]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBocfs_uid_gen\fR is used to create a GUID or recover a lost GUID. It uses the NIC MAC address to generate the GUID and needs to be executed only once in most of the situations. The first time it is executed, it has to be invoked with the \-c option. The only exception is when the NIC that is used by ocfs is replaced, in this case, the \-r option should be used. When the \-r option is invoked to recover a GUID, the first mount needs to be invoked using the arguments "\-o reclaimid" or the mount will fail.
