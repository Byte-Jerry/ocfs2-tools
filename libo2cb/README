Here's how to get the basics working:
  * plunk down otcp.o, onm.o, ohb.o and odlm.o somewhere in your
      module path and run depmod (or better yet, symlink each to
      your build tree and run depmod -ar)
  * make an /etc/cluster.conf.  example:
	cluster_name=foofers
	0,ca-test31,139.185.118.131,8765
	1,ca-test32,139.185.118.132,7654
	2,ca-test33,139.185.118.133,9977
    the node format is <nodenum>,<nodename>,<ip>,<port>
  * run clusterbo as root
  * run "mount -t ocfs2 /dev/device /mount/point"
    -o options: hbdev=different-device -or-
                hbuuid=different-uuid
                to heartbeat on a different device than
                the one you are mounting
