.SH "NAME"
mkfs.ocfs2 \- Build an OCFS2 file system.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR [ \fB\-b\fR \fIblocksize\fR ] [ \fB\-c\fR \fIcluster\-size\fR ] [ \fB\-L\fR \fIvolume\-label\fR ] [ \fB\-n\fR \fInumber\-of\-nodes\fR ] [ \fB\-q\fR ] [ \fB\-v\fR ] [ \fB\-V\fR ] \fIdevice\fR [ \fIblocks\-count\fR ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR is used to build an OCFS2 file system on a \fIdevice\fR, usually a partition in a shared disk. In order to prevent data loss, \fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR will not format a specified device if a node has it mounted. Different than OCFS, there is no need to mount the partition exclusively after formatting it.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fIblocksize\fR
\fIBlocksize\fR can be specified in bytes or kbytes. The value of the blocksize can range from 512 to 4096 bytes (512-4k).

.TP
\fB\-C\fR \fIcluster\-size\fR
\fICluster\-size\fR are specified in kbytes and range from 4k to 1M. The size of the cluster-size will determine the maximum filesystem size possible for the OCFS2 (32Gb\-8Tb). For database files, 128k \fIcluster\-size\fR is still recommended. For use as a generic filesystem, 4k \fIcluster\-size\fR is recommended.

.TP
\fB\-L\fR \fIvolume\-label\fR
\fIVolume\-label\fR is usefull when the LABEL option is used to mount the partitions.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fInumber\-of\-nodes\fR 
\fInumber\-of\-nodes\fR specify the max number of nodes where the partition will be mounted. That will allow a better control of allocated space and make OCFS2 more efficient.

.TP
\fB\-q\fR 
Execute \fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR in quiet mode. 

.TP
\fB\-v\fR 
Execute \fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR in verbose mode.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR 
Print version and exit.

.TP
\fB[blocks\-count]\fR 
Specify the number of blocks on the device. If not specified, \fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR will automatically take the whole partition and format it.
